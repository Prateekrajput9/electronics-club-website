    "fullDescription": "The main objective of this project is to simulate the piano which produces different musical notes without using piano keys and according to the distance of the finger tip from the ultrasonic sensor. For making this project we used the Arduino IDE software in which we wrote a code for detecting the distance of the fingertip from the sensor. Then using the Python programming language, we connected the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE software with the Python. Python code mainly comprises of the code of connecting the Serial Monitor and then storing the various notes in wav audio format like Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dh, Ni in an array. Future versions could incorporate advanced features like dynamic volume modulation, portability and support for multiple octaves to enhance its versatility.",

The 1 Hz signal is fed to the IC 4026, which converts clock pulses into outputs for the 7-segment displays. We used combinational logic to make the IC 4060s work together with the rest of the identical ICs properly—for example, to increase the minute count only after 60 seconds have passed using the output from the earlier ICs. We can adjust time using switches at the hour and minute levels.",

The solution is very simple, we take in moisture level of soil using an industrial grade soil moisture sensor and send the data via wireless communication method using HTTP requests, to another microcontroller, which ensures the turning off and on of a solenoid valve. When turned on, the valve switches to let the water flow through it. This simple method reduced water wastage and the sensor can be easily calibrated according to season, soil type etc. The battery that powers the microcontroller connected to sensor is recharged using a solar panel making it usable for long term. The microcontroller on the other side is powered using a 5V adapter.",

The goal is to design the AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) version of ASCON in Verilog, emphasizing modularity, efficiency, and correctness. The implementation includes a core permutation module that operates on a 320-bit internal state using substitution and linear diffusion layers across multiple rounds, and a controller FSM that orchestrates the various phases of encryption, such as initialization, associated data absorption, plaintext processing, and finalization. The FSM is designed to handle control signals robustly and manage corner cases, including scenarios with no associated data or plaintext. So far, the permutation module and controller have been successfully implemented, and the encryption functionality has been completed and verified. The design processes associated data, encrypts plaintext into ciphertext, and generates the authentication tag correctly. Currently, work has begun on implementing the decryption flow, which involves reversing the encryption logic while ensuring integrity verification through tag checking. The project is moving toward full integration and testing of the complete AEAD scheme, including simulation and potential hardware synthesis.",
